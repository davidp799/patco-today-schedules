Simple AWS CLI-based CloudWatch alarm to monitor S3 upload activity for the patco-today bucket.

## Files

- `README.md`: This documentation

## Alarm Details

The alarm monitors S3 upload activity and triggers when:
- No file uploads have occurred to the `patco-today` bucket for 24+ consecutive hours
- Uses S3 metrics from CloudWatch to detect activity
- Automatically sends email notifications to:

  - david.r.pape@gmail.com

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- AWS CLI installed and configured
- PowerShell (Windows) or equivalent permissions

### Deploy the Alarm

```powershell
# Simple deployment - creates alarm + SNS topic + email subscriptions
.\create-alarm-cli.ps1
```

### Custom Configuration

```powershell
# Custom bucket name and threshold
.\create-alarm-cli.ps1 -BucketName "my-bucket" -HoursWithoutActivity 48
```

3. **Monitor alarm status** in AWS CloudWatch console

## Testing

To test the alarm:
1. Wait for 24+ hours without uploading files to S3 (alarm will trigger)
2. Upload a test file: `aws s3 cp testfile.txt s3://patco-today/`
3. Alarm should return to OK state
4. Check that you receive email notifications for both state changes

## Monitoring Commands

```powershell
# Check alarm status
aws cloudwatch describe-alarms --alarm-names PATCO-S3-No-Upload-Activity

## Integration with PATCO System

This alarm integrates with your PATCO schedule system:
- **Daily uploads** occur around midnight UTC via Lambda â†’ Rock Pi workflow
- **24-hour threshold** catches missed daily processing cycles
- **Email alerts** notify you immediately when the system fails
- **Recovery monitoring** confirms when uploads resume
